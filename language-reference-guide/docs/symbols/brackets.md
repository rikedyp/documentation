## Round Parentheses

Parentheses (round brackets):

-   modify the [order of execution](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/expressions) in APL expressions
-   indicate [namelists](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/traditional-functions-and-operators/namelists) in function/operator headers
-   surround [definitions of namespaces and vectors](../../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/arrays/array-notation), from `()` (an empty namespace) to definitions that span multiple lines

A single right parenthesis begins a [System Command](../system-commands/introduction.md).

<!-- Round brackets (parentheses) are used in [APL expressions](../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/expressions) to control the order of execution.  They are also used in function/operator headers to indicate [Namelists](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/traditional-functions-and-operators/namelists).  A right parenthesis is also used to introduce a [System Command](../system-commands/introduction.md).

Parentheses can also surround definitions of namespaces and vectors, from `()` (an empty namespace) to definitions that span multiple lines: see [Array Notation](../../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/arrays/array-notation).

## Square Brackets

<!-- -   
Square brackets have several distinct meanings in Dyalog:

They are used to select sub-arrays from an n-dimensional array, and to indicate an axis along which a function (operand) is to apply – see [Bracket Indexing](../primitive-functions/indexing.md) and [Bracket Axis Operator](../primitive-operators/operators-summarised.md).
-   They can surround definitions of arrays of rank 2 or higher; these definitions can span multiple lines – see [Array Notation](../../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/arrays/array-notation).
-   A right bracket is used to introduce a user command – see [User Commands](../../../windows-ui-guide/user-commands).
 -->
Square brackets:

-   [select sub-arrays](../primitive-functions/indexing.md) from an *n*-dimensional array
-   [indicate an axis](../primitive-operators/operators-summarised.md) along which to apply a function
-   surround [definitions of arrays](../../../../programming-reference-guide/introduction/arrays/array-notation) of rank 2 or higher; these definitions can span multiple lines

A single right bracket begins a [User Command](../../../windows-ui-guide/user-commands).


## Curly Brackets

<!-- Curly brackets have three distinct meanings in Dyalog. They are used to indicate shy results and optional left arguments in defined functions. They are also used to enclose the definition of a dfn and a dop. See [Model Syntax](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/traditional-functions-and-operators/model-syntax) and [Dfns & Dops](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/dfns-and-dops/dynamic-functions-and-operators). -->

Curly brackets:

-   indicate [shy results and optional left arguments](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/traditional-functions-and-operators/model-syntax) in defined functions
-   enclose the [definition of a dfn or a dop](../../../programming-reference-guide/defined-functions-and-operators/dfns-and-dops/dynamic-functions-and-operators)
