!!! note "Classic Edition"
    The symbol `⍛` is not available in Classic Edition, and the Behind operator is instead represented by `⎕U235b`.

`f` can be any monadic function which returns a result. Its result must be suitable as the left argument to the funtion `g`.

`g` can be any dyadic function, and it does not need to return a result.

`Y` can be any array that is suitable as the right argument to the function `g`.
If `X` is omitted, `Y` must also be suitable as the right argument to the function `X`.

`X` can be any array that is suitable as the right argument to the function `f`.

The derived function is equivalent to either `(f Y) g Y` or `(f X) g Y`, depending on whether `X` is specified or not.

The Behind operator allows functions to be *glued* together to build up more complex functions. For further information, see [Function Composition](./operator-syntax.md).
